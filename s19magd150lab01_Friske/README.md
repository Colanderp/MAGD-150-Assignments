# Lab 1
### Static Composition in Black and White
#### 100/100 Points

### Requirements
1. Adhere to the theme: Buildings
2. Sketch's minimum size: 128 x 128
3. Sketch must have a background
4. Use only grayscale colors
5. Use atleast two of each of the following primitives:
* Point
* Line
* Ellipse
* Rectangle

6. Use primitives with either no stroke or no fill
7. Change the display mode for an ellipse, rectangle, stroke cap or join
8. Compose with the following in mind:
* Symmetry: If the sketch were folded, would it look the same on both sides of the fold?
* Contrast: How much do the elements of the sketch stand out or blend in relationship to each other? In mathematical terms, what are the minimum and maximum differences between the fill and stroke color of the elements?
* Grouping: Are like or unlike elements grouped together, repeated at regular or irregular intervals? Are they combined to form a symbol or representational image?
* Scale: How do the relative sizes of the elements influence our perception of them?
9. Ensure that the sketch runs without errors
